        <h2 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">Investing approaches can be broadly classified into two types:-
        </h2>


        <ol class="arrow-list py-5">
            <li>Top-Down Approach </li>
            <li>Bottom-Up Approach</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">TOP-DOWN APPROACH</h2>
        <p class="pb-6">
            The top-down approach to investing focuses on the big picture, or how the overall economy and macroeconomic
            factors drive the markets and, ultimately, stock prices. They will also look at the performance of sectors
            or industries. These investors believe that if the sector is doing well, chances are, the stocks in those
            industries will also do well.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-6">
            In the top-down investment approach, we first analyse the countries according to the macro factors; then we
            move on to the sector and industry analysis; and finally to the company analysis. We can select the factors
            on the basis of which we will analyse these according to our requirements and suitability. We will talk
            about several factors further in out E-learning module.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">BOTTOM UP APPROACH</h2>
        <p class="pb-6">
            Generally, the bottom-up approach focuses its analysis on specific characteristics and micro attributes of
            an individual stock. In bottom-up investing concentration is on business-by-business or sector-by-sector
            fundamentals. This analysis seeks to identify profitable opportunities through the idiosyncrasies of a
            companyâ€™s attributes and its valuations in comparison to the market
        </p>
        <p class="pb-6">
            Bottom-up investing begins its research at the company level but does not stop there. These analyses weigh
            company fundamentals heavily but also look at the sector, and microeconomic factors as well. As such,
            bottom-up investing can be somewhat broad across an entire industry or laser-focused on identifying key
            attributes. The bottom-up approach is exactly the opposite of the top-down approach. First we identify the
            company by fundamental analysis, then we analyse the respective industry and sector and finally we analyse
            the country.
