            <li>The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying,
                selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. </li>
            <li>Such financial activities are conducted through institutionalised formal exchanges or over-the-counter
                (OTC) marketplaces which operate under a defined set of regulations. </li>
            <li>There can be multiple stock trading venues in a country or a region which allow transactions in stocks
                and other forms of securities.</li>
            <li>Stock markets are where individual and institutional investors come together to buy and sell shares in a
                public venue.</li>
            <li>Nowadays these exchanges exist as electronic marketplaces.</li>
            <li>Stock exchanges are secondary markets, where existing owners of shares can transact with potential
                buyers.</li>
            <li>Though it is called a stock market or equity market and is primarily known for trading stocks/equities,
                other financial securities - like exchange traded funds (ETF), corporate bonds and derivatives based on
                stocks, commodities, currencies, and bonds - are also traded in the stock markets.</li>
            <li>The stock exchange acts as a facilitator for this capital raising process and receives a fee for its
                services from the company and its financial partners. </li>
            <li>This constitutes the secondary market. The stock exchange earns a fee for every trade that occurs on its
                platform during the secondary market activity. </li>
            <li>The stock exchange shoulders the responsibility of ensuring price transparency, liquidity, price
                discovery and fair dealings in such trading activities. </li>
            <li>As almost all major stock markets across the globe now operate electronically, the exchange maintains
                trading systems that efficiently manage the buy and sell orders from various market participants. </li>
            <li>They perform the price matching function to facilitate trade execution at a price fair to both buyers
                and sellers. </li>
            <li>A listed company may also offer new, additional shares through other offerings at a later stage, like
                through rights issue or through follow-on offers. </li>
            <li>They may even buyback or delist their shares. The stock exchange facilitates such transactions. </li>
            <li>The stock exchange often creates and maintains various market-level and sector-specific indicators, like
                the S&P 500 index or Nasdaq 100 index, which provide a measure to track the movement of the overall
                market. </li>
            <li>The stock exchanges also maintain all company news, announcements, and financial reporting, which can be
                usually accessed on their official websites</li>
        </ol>



        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">FUNCTIONS OF A STOCK MARKET</h2>

        <ol class="arrow-list py-5">
            <li>Fair Dealing in Securities Transactions: Depending on the standard rules of demand and supply, the stock
                exchange needs to ensure that all interested market participants have instant access to data for all buy
                and sell orders thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities.</li>
            <li>Efficient Price Discovery: Stock markets need to support an efficient mechanism for price discovery,
                which refers to the act of deciding the proper price of a security and is usually performed by assessing
                market supply and demand and other factors associated with the transactions.</li>
            <li>
                Liquidity Maintenance: While getting the number of buyers and sellers for a particular financial
                security are out of control for the stock market, it needs to ensure that whosoever is qualified and
                willing to trade gets instant access to place orders which should get executed at the fair price.
            </li>

            <li>Security and Validity of Transactions: While more participants are important for efficient working of a
                market, the same market needs to ensure that all participants are verified and remain compliant with the
                necessary rules and regulations, leaving no room for default by any of the parties. </li>
            <li>Support All Eligible Types of Participants: A marketplace is made by a variety of participants, which
                include market makers, investors, traders, speculators, and hedgers. All these participants operate in
                the stock market with different roles and functions.</li>
            <li>Investor Protection: Along with wealthy and institutional investors, a very large number of small
                investors are also served by the stock market for their small amount of investments. These investors may
                have limited financial knowledge, and may not be fully aware of the pitfalls of investing in stocks and
                other listed instruments. The stock exchange must implement necessary measures to offer the necessary
                protection to such investors to shield them from financial loss and ensure customer trust.</li>
            <li>Balanced Regulation: Listed companies are largely regulated and their dealings are monitored by market
                regulators, like the Securities and Exchange Board of India of the U.S. Additionally, exchanges also
                mandate certain requirements â€“ like, timely filing of quarterly financial reports and instant reporting
                of any relevant developments - to ensure all market participants become aware of corporate happenings.
                Failure to adhere to the regulations can lead to suspension of trading by the exchanges and other
                disciplinary measures.</li>
