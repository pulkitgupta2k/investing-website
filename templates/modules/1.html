            <li> Money is a medium of exchange; it allows people to obtain what they need to live. </li>
            <li> Money makes the world go around. </li>
            <li> Economies rely on the exchange of money for products and services. </li>
            <li> Economists define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. </li>
            <li> Money is commonly referred to as currency. </li>
            <li> Economically, each country has its own money system</li>

        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">Types of Money</h2>

        <ol class="arrow-list">
            <li>Commodity money</li>
            <li>Fiat money</li>
            <li>Fiduciary money</li>
        </ol>



        <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 my-6 italic rounded">
            We are going to discuss Fiat money since it the most common form of money.
        </div>

        <ol class="line-list">
            <li>Fiat money is a government-issued currency that isn't backed by a commodity such as gold. </li>
            <li>Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money
                is printed.</li>
            <li>Most modern paper currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Indian Rupee, are fiat currencies.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">How Does Fiat Money Work</h2>

        <ol class="arrow-list">
            <li>Fiat money only has value because the government maintains that value, or because two parties in a
                transaction agree on its value.</li>
            <li> Fiat money is inconvertible and cannot be redeemed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">Advantages</h2>

        <ol class="line-list">
            <li>Fiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a nation's economy needs of its
                monetary unitâ€”storing value, providing a numerical account, and facilitating exchange.</li>
            <li>Since fiat money is not a scarce or fixed resource like gold, central banks have much greater control
                over its supply, which gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply,
                liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-gray-800 font-bold my-5">Disadvantages</h2>

        <ol class="line-list">
            <li>The mortgage crisis of 2007 and subsequent financial meltdown, however, tempered the belief that central
                banks could necessarily prevent depressions or serious recessions by regulating the money supply. </li>
            <li>A currency tied to gold, for example, is generally more stable than fiat money because of the limited
                supply of gold.</li>
            <li>There are more opportunities for the creation of bubbles with fiat money due to its unlimited supply.
            </li>
        </ol>
